## Virus Alert App

This was the first Coronavirus iOS app to be built back in February before the copy-cat apps started to appear. This app was never released because Apple has denied any app that reports on the coronavirus topic that isn't from an official health organization.

Key technologies leveraged:
* ArcGIS Map SDK
* Promises
* Google Cloud Storage
* Pipedream Node.js serverless lambda function
